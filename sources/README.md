# Source Notes

### Building just the font

The font file `fonts/Foo-VF.ttf` is built from source using the following command from the root directory:

```
python sources/BUILD.py && gftools fix-dsig fonts/*.ttf --autofix
```

Dependencies installed should include:

 - [fontmake](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake)

 - [ttfautohint](https://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/)

### Building the font and updating the specimen

When building the font, the specimen can also be updated and regenerated. Simply add an extra command to the above build commands line.
